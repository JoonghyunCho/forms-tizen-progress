# Known Issues

Due to the inherent nature of Tizen, the Tizen backend contains a few limitations on the Xamarin.Forms APIs - these limitations are to be eliminated in future releases.
The following classes are not supported:
 - AppLinkEntry
 - OpenGLView

A full list of limitations across devices is available at [here](https://developer.tizen.org/development/api-reference/.net-application/current-xamarin.forms-limitations).
